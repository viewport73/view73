"View73" is my demo graphics and game framework using opengl, bullet and boost. First time i am learning how to use bullet and boost,
so code is little bit messy, i wrote the code for myself so i didn't include any comments anywhere.. :(( .. Most of the application 
specific and gameplay code are hardcoded right now, those are just for test. I am doing this project for learning purpose. 
Scene management has very very basic scene graph implementation. Doesn't have any render queue occluder implementation.

Currently i am adding a shader systemusing "glew" to the framework but its not finished yet, working on my own file format and exporter 
from colada to my format.

Please don't judge just by the looking the output, Please look into the code as well...:))

* There is a working build in "WorkingBuild" folder if somehow code fails to compile.
